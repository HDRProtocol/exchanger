# Byteball / Ethereum Asset Exchanger Bot
Byteball / Ethereum Asset Exchanger Bot is a functional implementation of the interface solution used for the exchange of assets between the Byteball and Ethereum networks. 
 
Since the current implementation of Byteball / Ethereum Asset Exchanger Bot is based on a centralized solution, the modules for applying internal logic cannot be represented on GitHub. 
 
All elements of this solution are available for fully functional pair code testing. 
 
Further development of this cohesive Exchanger will aim towards decentralization of the solution, that will provide better representation of the product code on GitHub.
